      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>
        Create an account from the <strong>Sign up</strong> page, then log in
        to see your home feed. You can post an update any time using the
        composer at the top of your timeline.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I reset my password?</h2>
      <p>
        Password recovery isn't available in this preview yet. If you're
        stuck, try the demo account: username <strong>mahesh</strong>,
        password <strong>mahesh</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I switch between light and dark mode?</h2>
      <p>
        Use the toggle button in the bottom-right corner of the screen — it's
        available on every page and remembers your choice.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I delete a post?</h2>
      <p>
        Post management (editing and deleting tweets) is on our roadmap and
        isn't available yet in this version of Chirp.
      </p>
